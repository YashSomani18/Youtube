# Deep Dive into Technical Implementations
Debouncing in Search

Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, which can be detrimental to performance. In VideoStreamify, a 200ms debounce is applied to the search functionality. This means that the platform waits for 200 milliseconds after the user stops typing before making a search query. This approach significantly reduces the number of network calls made to the server, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the search functionality by 40%. It also provides a smoother user experience, as the search results are updated in a less disruptive manner.


Redux Caching
Redux caching is used to store previously fetched data in the state. When a user performs a search, the platform first checks the Redux store to see if the data is already available, reducing unnecessary network requests. This strategy not only speeds up the search process but also minimizes the load on the server.
